echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ ROTATE MONGODB ATLAS CREDENTIALS (DO THIS FIRST!)"
echo "   ‚Üí Go to MongoDB Atlas Dashboard"
echo "   ‚Üí Database Access ‚Üí Database Users"
echo "   ‚Üí Click 'Edit' next to user 'yemi'"
echo "   ‚Üí Change password to a new strong password"
echo "   ‚Üí Click 'Update User'"

echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ UPDATE LOCAL CONFIGURATION"
echo "   ‚Üí Update your .env file with the new credentials"
echo "   ‚Üí Update docker-compose.local.yml with new credentials"
echo "   ‚Üí Test the connection works"
echo ""

echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ RESTART DOCKER CONTAINERS"
echo "   ‚Üí Run: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d --force-recreate"

echo "4Ô∏è‚É£ VERIFY SECURITY HOOKS ARE ACTIVE"
echo "   ‚Üí Pre-commit hooks installed: ‚úÖ"
echo "   ‚Üí Git-secrets configured: ‚úÖ"
echo "   ‚Üí MongoDB URI detection: ‚úÖ"

echo "5Ô∏è‚É£ TEST THE SECURITY SYSTEM"
echo "   ‚Üí Try committing a file with 'AKIA' (fake AWS key)"
echo "   ‚Üí It should be blocked by the hooks"

echo "üîí Files that are now protected from being committed:"

echo "   ‚Ä¢ AWS credentials"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Private keys"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ MongoDB connection strings"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Other secrets and sensitive data"
echo ""

echo "üí° Usage going forward:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Always use: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Keep sensitive data in gitignored files only"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ The pre-commit hooks will automatically scan before each commit"

echo "üö´ IMPORTANT: If you had MongoDB credentials exposed, rotate them immediately!"
echo "   ‚Üí Change the database user password in MongoDB Atlas"
echo "   ‚Üí Update your local .env and docker-compose.local.yml files"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Once you've rotated the credentials, your system will be secure!"
